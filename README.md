# Architect Test

## Makers Academy Week 3 Test

The aim of the test was to write a software to control the flow of planes in an airport. This was our first weekly test about Ruby and proper OOP.

The task was set by [Evgeny Shadchnev](https://github.com/shadchnev).

### Features:
* Planes can land and take off, given the weather is sunny
* The weather is controlled by a random number generator, and is ocasionally stormy
* Every plane must have a status indicating whether it is flying or landed
* Once all the planes are in the air, check that they have the status of flying!
* Check when all the planes have landed that they have the right status "landed"
* Add messages to explain what is going on, e.g "Sorry! You can't take off due to stormy weather"

## Technologies used
* Ruby
* TDD with Rspec
